Ruby Types
==========

**Ruby Types** introduces *group of classes* as eqivalent to some data 
types in other languages such as `boolean` and allows introspection 
according to type of class too. In fact, partially replaces multiple 
inheritance because introduces unlimited formal genericity for every 
class.

For example define:

    class Boolean < Type
        def type_classes
            [TrueClass, FalseClass]
        end
    end
    
Then you can call:

    foo = 5
    bar = true
    
    foo.type_of? Boolean    # returns false
    bar.type_of? Boolean    # returns true
    
Binding back to classic behaviour works:

    foo.type_of? Numeric    # returns true
